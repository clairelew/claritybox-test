		<h3>My Philosophy</h3>
		<p>I believe people should be happier at work.</p>
		<p>The root cause of unhappiness at work lies in ineffective communication. The things we assume and choose not to disclose with one another are what hurt a company the most. As Peter Senge says:  "Structures of which we are unaware hold us prisoner."</p>
		<p>As a result, the key to a happier, more productive company is open and honest communication. Communication enables clarity. And a company must be able to see itself clearly in order to improve.</p>
		<p>I believe that this improvement should happen proactively. A company shouldn't wait for an internal crisis to serve as a wake-up call. It should be constantly seeking the truth of how it's doing. A company that consistently cares about this truth is built for the long-haul.</p>
		<p>Here are the values I believe in and practice:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Authenticity:  I truly care and am driven by what is in the best interest of the organization.</li>
			<li>Simplicity:  I focus on what is essential. Itâ€™s maximizing impact with the least amount of excess.</li>
			<li>Honesty:  I seek out the truth, while being transparent in my own intentions and shortcomings.</li>
			<li>Trust:  The relationship I have with the organization is predicated on trust, and will never be violated.</li>
		</ul>
